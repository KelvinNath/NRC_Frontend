# Vercel Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Deploy

1. **Push your changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel will automatically detect the changes and redeploy**

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Issue 1: Vite Command Not Found**
- **Problem**: `vite` was in `devDependencies` but Vercel needs it during build
- **Solution**: Moved `vite` to `dependencies` in `package.json`

### **Issue 2: Missing Build Configuration**
- **Problem**: `vercel.json` didn't specify build settings
- **Solution**: Added proper build configuration

### **Issue 3: Missing Vercel Ignore**
- **Problem**: Unnecessary files were being uploaded
- **Solution**: Added `.vercelignore` file

## 📁 Configuration Files

### **vercel.json**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "vite",
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  },
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
  ]
}
```

### **package.json Changes**
- `vite` moved from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`

### **.vercelignore**
- Excludes unnecessary files from deployment

## 🧪 Testing Locally

Before deploying, test your build:
```bash
npm run build
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Build Fails with "vite: command not found"**
- Ensure `vite` is in `dependencies` (not `devDependencies`)
- Check that `vercel.json` has correct `buildCommand`

### **Build Succeeds but App Doesn't Work**
- Check `outputDirectory` in `vercel.json` matches your build output
- Verify `rewrites` configuration for SPA routing

### **Environment Variables**
- Set any required environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Don't commit `.env` files to Git

## 📊 Build Performance

- **Build time**: ~34 seconds (as of latest build)
- **Bundle size**: Optimized with Vite
- **Chunking**: Automatic code splitting enabled

## 🔄 Automatic Deployments

- Vercel automatically deploys on every push to `main` branch
- Preview deployments are created for pull requests
- Build logs are available in Vercel dashboard

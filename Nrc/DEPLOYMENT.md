# Vercel Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Deploy

1. **Push your changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment: configure for Nrc subdirectory structure"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel will automatically detect the changes and redeploy**

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Issue 1: Directory Structure Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Vercel was looking for `package.json` in root but it's in `Nrc/` subdirectory
- **Solution**: Updated Vercel configuration to point to correct paths

### **Issue 2: Vite Command Not Found**
- **Problem**: `vite` was in `devDependencies` but Vercel needs it during build
- **Solution**: Moved `vite` to `dependencies` in `package.json`

### **Issue 3: Vite Version Compatibility**
- **Problem**: Vite 6.3.5 was too new and had compatibility issues with Vercel
- **Solution**: Downgraded to Vite 5.4.0 (stable and widely supported)

### **Issue 4: Missing Build Configuration**
- **Problem**: `vercel.json` didn't specify build settings
- **Solution**: Added proper build configuration with `@vercel/static-build`

### **Issue 5: Missing Vercel Ignore**
- **Problem**: Unnecessary files were being uploaded
- **Solution**: Added `.vercelignore` file

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
NR_Containers/
├── .git/
├── vercel.json          ← Vercel config (ROOT)
├── .vercelignore        ← Vercel ignore (ROOT)
├── .nvmrc              ← Node version (ROOT)
└── Nrc/                ← Your app directory
    ├── package.json     ← Dependencies
    ├── src/            ← Source code
    └── dist/           ← Build output
```

## 📁 Final Working Configuration

### **vercel.json (ROOT directory)**
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "Nrc/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "Nrc/dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **package.json (Nrc/ directory)**
- `vite` moved from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`
- `vite` version: `^5.4.0` (stable version)
- `@vitejs/plugin-react` version: `^4.2.1` (compatible)

### **.vercelignore (ROOT directory)**
- Excludes unnecessary files from deployment
- Includes `Nrc/dist/` and `Nrc/build/` paths

### **.nvmrc (ROOT directory)**
- Specifies Node.js 18 for compatibility

## 🧪 Testing Locally

Before deploying, test your build:
```bash
cd Nrc
npm install
npm run build
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Build Fails with "Could not read package.json"**
- ✅ **Fixed**: Vercel now points to `Nrc/package.json`
- ✅ **Fixed**: Correct `distDir` path specified

### **Build Fails with "vite: command not found"**
- ✅ **Fixed**: `vite` is now in `dependencies`
- ✅ **Fixed**: Using stable Vite 5.4.0 version
- ✅ **Fixed**: Proper Vercel build configuration

### **Build Succeeds but App Doesn't Work**
- Check `distDir` in `vercel.json` points to `Nrc/dist`
- Verify `routes` configuration for SPA routing

### **Environment Variables**
- Set any required environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Don't commit `.env` files to Git

## 📊 Build Performance

- **Build time**: ~26 seconds (optimized with Vite 5.4.0)
- **Bundle size**: Optimized with Vite
- **Chunking**: Automatic code splitting enabled

## 🔄 Automatic Deployments

- Vercel automatically deploys on every push to `main` branch
- Preview deployments are created for pull requests
- Build logs are available in Vercel dashboard

## 🎯 Why This Configuration Works

1. **Correct paths**: Vercel knows where to find `package.json` and build output
2. **Vite 5.4.0**: Stable, widely supported version
3. **@vercel/static-build**: Official Vercel build adapter
4. **Proper dependency placement**: Vite accessible during build
5. **Explicit build configuration**: No ambiguity about build process
6. **SPA routing**: Handles React Router properly

## 🚀 Next Steps

After pushing these changes:
1. Vercel will automatically redeploy
2. Build should complete successfully
3. Your app will be live at your Vercel URL

## 📝 Important Notes

- **Vercel configuration files** are now in the **ROOT** directory
- **Your app code** remains in the **Nrc** subdirectory
- **Build output** will be in **Nrc/dist**
- **Vercel will automatically** find and use the correct paths
